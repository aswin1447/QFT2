# Homework

Some students, but not a majority, asked for weekly homework. To try to accomodate
everyone, we will trying something new: a "running" homework assignment.

The associated document will be one PDF for all homework this semester,
with problems added as I develop or teach the lectures. Hopefully this will be
useful for the students that wanted more regular assignments to help keep up with lecture.
However, problems will be due biweekly. Additional instructions are in the document.

Take-home exams may also be put in this document.

See the syllabus for additonal comments on the homework.

**A request:** Typos are inevitable, and I apologize in advance for them. Please let
me know as soon as possible if you notice one, so that I can correct it.
