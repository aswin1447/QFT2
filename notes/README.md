# Approximate Lecture Notes

In this folder you can find PDFs of the lecture notes. I will mostly follow
them while lecturing, though there may be some departures based on
insightful questions.

Unlike last semester, notes will often not be posted ahead of the lecture,
as they are still under significant development due to the very recent addition
of this course. I will try to post somewhat regularly, though.
