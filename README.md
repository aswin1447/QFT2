## Course Information

*Course Schedule:* Lectures M 10:00-11:40, R 1:30-3:10

*Course Location:* Churchill 321

*Description:* The goal of this course is for you to learn second and third semester topics in quantum field theory. We will cover non-abelian gauge theory, more condensed matter applications, supersymmetry, and conformal field theory.

*Preparation:* A strong and broad background in quantum field theory is necessary. [See here](https://github.com/jimhalverson/QFT1).

*Resources:* The primary textbook for this course is:
- Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model, M. Schwartz.

I will again lecture from my notes, which draw from a number of sources. The sources for each section of the course are listed under course material. Collectively, they are:

- Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell (2nd Ed.), A. Zee.
- Condensed Matter Field Theory, A. Altland and B. Simons
- Supersymmetry and Supergravity, J. Wess and J. Bagger
- An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory, M. Peskin and D. Schroeder.
- [Applied Conformal Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108028), by Paul Ginsparg.
- [A supersymmetry primer](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9709356), by Stephen Martin.

*Homework and Exams:* There will be biweekly homework assignments designed to help guide you through the material. There will be a take home midterm and final exam, each of which will involve one or more classic computations in quantum field theory. There will also be an in-class midterm. Homework may be a joint effort, but the exams must be your work and yours alone. The texts above may be used on exams.

*Late homework policy:* Illness and other things come up sometimes, so homework may be turned in within 10 days of the due date, but with a 25% penalty. However, it is strongly recommended to not get behind on the class material in order to complete a past due homework.


*Academic Integrity:* Be sure to review Northeastern Academic Integrity policies, which are [here](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/).

*Grading:* 20% homework, 40% midterm (20% in class, 20% take home), 40% final exam.

## Course Material

Topics are organized according to order of presentation. I had originally imagined beginning with condensed matter for the sake of fluidity with last semester, but some aspects of non-abelian gauge theory may be important there. 

- ***Topic 1: Non-abelian Gauge Theory***

  We will work primarily from my notes and Schwartz.
    - Group Theory
    - Yang-Mills Theory
    - Gauge Fixing and Fadeev-Popov
    - Feynman Rules
    - Physical States and BRST Cohomology
    - Asymptotic Freedom of Yang-Mills and QCD
    - Gauge Anomalies


- ***Topic 2: More Condensed Matter***

  We will work primarily from Zee and Peskin-Schroeder.
    - Fermions in arbitrary dimensions
    - Topological Defects (Instantons)
    - Non-linear sigma model, (anti) ferromagnetism, and asymptotic freedom
    - Chern-Simons theory
    - Particle-vortex duality


- ***Topic 3: Supersymmetry***

  We will work primarily from Wess-Bagger and Martin.
    - Two component spinors and identities
    - SUSY algebra and representations
    - Component fields
    - Superfields
    - Chiral Superfields
    - Vector Superfields
    - Gauge Invariant Interactions
    - Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
    - Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and SUSY Phenomenology


- ***Topic 4: Conformal Field Theory***

  We will work primarily from Ginsparg.
    - Conformal theories in d-dimensions
    - Conformal theories in 2 dimensions
    - Central Charge and Virasoro Algebra

## Comments and Recommendations

- Each topic in the course will begin with a brief discussion of the central ideas and why they are important.
- Since this material can be quite dense with formalism, each lecture will begin with a concrete outline and an explanation of the basic logic behind the physics presented in the lecture.
- During lecture, please ask questions! An interactive classroom will be beneficial to all.
- We will cover a lot of material, and it is important to not get behind.
